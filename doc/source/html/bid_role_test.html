<div class="contents">
<div class="textblock"><p>The test role is very similar to the application role, it also builds an executable binary.</p>
<p>The difference is that is also builds for each target a test script that executes the test target either on the host (MODE=host) or a target platform (currently only qemu).</p>
<p>The role accepts all make variables that are accepted by the application role. The only difference is that the <code>TARGET</code> variable is not required. If it is missing, the source directory will be scanned for source files that fit the pattern <code>test_*.c[c]</code> and create one target for each of them.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>It is possible to still use SRC_C[C] when targets are determined automatically. In that case the specified sources will be used in addition* to the main <code>test_*.c[c]</code> source.</dd></dl>
<p>In addition to the variables above, there are a number of variables that control how the test is executed. All these variables may be used as a global variable that applies to all test or, if the target name is added as a suffix, set for a specific target only.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_TARGET</dt><dd>Name of binary containing the test (default: same as <code>TARGET</code>).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TARGET_$(ARCH)</dt><dd>When TARGET is undefined, these targets are added to the list of targets for the specified architecture. For all targets <code>SRC_C[C]</code> files must be defined separately.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_EXPECTED</dt><dd>File containing expected output. By default the variable is empty, which means the test binary is expected to produce TAP test output, that can be directly processed.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_EXPECTED_REPEAT</dt><dd>Number of times the expected output should be repeated, by default 1. When set to 0 then output is expected to repeat forever. This is particularly useful to make sure that stress tests that are meant to run in an endless loop are still alive. Note that such endless tests can only be run by directly executing the test script. They will be skipped when run in a test harness like <code>prove</code>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_TIMEOUT</dt><dd>Non-standard timeout after which the test run is aborted (useful for tests involving sleep).</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>NED_CFG</dt><dd>LUA configuration file for startup to give to Ned</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>REQUIRED_MODULES</dt><dd>Additional modules needed to run the test.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>QEMU_ARGS</dt><dd>Additional parameters to supply to QEMU.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>MOE_ARGS</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>Additional parameters to supply to moe.</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>KERNEL_CONF</dt><dd>Features the Fiasco kernel must have been compiled with. A space-separated list of config options as used by Kconfig. <code>run_test</code> looks for a <code>globalconfig.out</code> file in the same directory as the kernel and checks that all options are enabled. If not, the test is skipped. Has only an effect if the <code>globalconfig.out</code> file is present.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>L4LINUX_CONF</dt><dd>Features the L4Linux kernel must have been compiled with. Similar to <code>KERNEL_CONF</code> but checks for a <code>.config</code> file in the directory of the L4Linux kernel.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_SETUP</dt><dd>Command to execute before the test is run. The test will only be executed if the command returns 0. If the exit code is 2, the test is marked as skipped with the reason provided in the final line of stdout.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_LOGFILE</dt><dd>Append output of test execution to the given file unless TEST_WORKDIR is given.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>TEST_WORKDIR</dt><dd>Create logs, temp and other files below the given directory. That directory is taken as base dir for more automatically created subdir levels using the current test path, in order to guarantee conflict-free usage when running many different tests with a common workdir. When TEST_WORKDIR is provided then TEST_LOGFILE is ignored as it is organized below workdir.</dd></dl>
<p>In addition to compiled tests, it is also possible to create tests where the test binary or script comes from a different source. These tests must be listed in <code>EXTRA_TARGET</code> and for each target a custom <code>TEST_TARGET</code> must be provided.</p>
<h2>Running Tests </h2>
<p>The make role creates a test script which can be found in <code>&lt;builddir&gt;/test/t/&lt;arch&gt;/&lt;api&gt;</code>. It is possible to organise the tests further in subdirectories below by specifying a TEST_GROUP.</p>
<p>To be able to execute the test, a minimal test environment needs to be set up by exporting the following environment variables:</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>KERNEL_&lt;arch&gt;, KERNEL</dt><dd>Fiasco kernel binary to use. The test runner is able to check if the kernel has all features necessary for the test and skip tests accordingly. In order for this to work, the <code>globalconfig.out</code> config file from the build directory needs to be available in the same directory as the kernel.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>L4LX_KERNEL_&lt;arch&gt;, L4_LX_KERNEL</dt><dd>L4Linux binary to use. This is only required to run tests in <code>mode=l4linux</code>. If no L4Linux kernel is set then these tests will simply be skipped. The test runner is also able to check if the kernel has all features compiled in that are required to run the test successfully (see make variable <code>L4LINUX_CONF</code> above). For this to work, the <code>.config</code> configuration file from the build directory needs to be available in the same directory as the kernel.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>LINUX_RAMDISK_&lt;arch&gt;, LINUX_RAMDISK</dt><dd>Ramdisk to mount as root in L4Linux. This is only required to run tests in <code>mode=l4linux</code>. If not supplied, L4Linux tests will be skipped. The ramdisk must be set up to start the test directly after the initial startup is finished. The name of the test binary is supplied via the kernel command line option <code>l4re_testprog</code>. The <code>tool/test</code> directory contains an example script <code>launch-l4linux-test</code>. which can be copied onto the ramdisk and started by the init script.</dd></dl>
<p>In addition to these variables, the following BID variables can be overwritten at runtime: <code>PT</code> (for the plaform type) and <code>TEST_TIMEOUT</code>. You may also supply <code>QEMU_ARGS</code> and <code>MOE_ARGS</code> which will be appended to the parameters specified in the BID test make file.</p>
<p>Once the environment is set up, the tests can be run either by simply executing all of them from the build directory with </p><pre class="fragment">make test
</pre><p>or executing them directly, like </p><pre class="fragment">test/t/amd64_amdfam10/l4f/l4re-core/moe/test_namespace.t
</pre><p>or running one or more tests through the test harness <a href="http://perldoc.perl.org/prove.html">prove</a>, like </p><pre class="fragment">prove test/t/amd64_amdfam10/l4f/l4re-core/moe/test_namespace.t
prove -r test/t/amd64_amdfam10/l4f/l4re-core/
prove -rv test/t/amd64_amdfam10/l4f/l4re-core/
</pre><h2>Running Tests in External Programs </h2>
<p>You can hand-over test execution to an external program by setting the environment variable <code>EXTERNAL_TEST_STARTER</code> to the full path of that program: </p><pre class="fragment">export EXTERNAL_TEST_STARTER=/path/to/external/test-starter
make test
</pre><dl class="section user"><dt>EXTERNAL_TEST_STARTER</dt><dd></dd></dl>
<p>This variable is evaluated by <code>tool/bin/run_test</code> (the backend behind <code>make test</code>) and contains the full path to the tool which actually starts the test instead of the test itself.</p>
<p>The <code>EXTERNAL_TEST_STARTER</code> can be any program instead of the default execution via <code>make qemu E=maketest</code>. Its output is taken by <code>run_test</code> as the test output.</p>
<p>Usually it is just a bridge to prepare the test execution, e.g., it could create the test as image and start that image via a simulator.</p>
<h3>Running Tests in a Simulator</h3>
<p>Based on above mechanism there is a dedicated external test starter <code>tool/bin/teststarter-image-telnet.pl</code> shipped in BID which assumes an image to be started with another program which provides test execution output on a network port.</p>
<p>This can be used to execute tests in a simulator, like this: </p><pre class="fragment">export EXTERNAL_TEST_STARTER=$L4RE_SRC/tool/bin/teststarter-image-telnet.pl
export SIMULATOR_START=/path/to/configured/simulator-exe
make test
</pre><p>After building the image and starting the simulator it contacts the simulator via a network port (sometimes called "telnet" port) to pass-through its execution output as its own output so it gets captured by <code>run_test</code> as usual.</p>
<p>The following variables control <code>teststarter-image-telnet.pl</code>:</p>
<dl class="section user"><dt>SIMULATOR_START</dt><dd>This points to the full path of the program that actually starts the prepared test image. Most often this is the frontend script of your simulator environment which is pre-configured so that it actually works in the way that <code>teststarter-image-telnet.pl</code> expects from the following settings.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>SIMULATOR_IMAGETYPE</dt><dd>The image type to be generated via <code>make $SIMULATOR_IMAGETYPE E=maketest</code>. Default is <code>elfimage</code>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>SIMULATOR_HOST</dt><dd>The simulator will be contacted via socket on that host to read its output. Default is <code>localhost</code>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>SIMULATOR_PORT</dt><dd>The simulator will be contacted via socket on that port to read its output. Default is <code>11111</code>.</dd></dl>
<dl class="section user"><dt>SIMULATOR_START_SLEEPTIME</dt><dd>After starting the simulator it waits that many seconds before reading from the port. Default is <code>1</code> (second).</dd></dl>
<h2>Debugging Tests </h2>
<p>The test script is only a thin wrapper that sets up the test environment as it was defined in the make file and then executes two scripts: <code>tapper-wrapper</code> and <code>run_test</code>.</p>
<p>The main work horse of the two is <code>tool/bin/run_test</code>. It collects the necessary files and starts qemu to execute the test. This script is always required.</p>
<p>There is then a second script wrapped around the test runner: <code>tool/bin/tapper-wrapper</code>. This tool inspects the output of the test runner and reformats it, so that it can be read by tools like <code>prove</code>. If the test produces tap output, then the script scans for this output and filters away all the debug output. If <code>TEST_EXPECTED</code> was defined, then the script scans the output for the expected lines and prints a suitable TAP message with success or failure. It also makes sure that qemu is killed as soon as the test is finished.</p>
<p>There are a number of command-line parameters that allow to quickly change test parameters for debugging purposes. Run the test with '&ndash;help' for more information about available parameters. </p>

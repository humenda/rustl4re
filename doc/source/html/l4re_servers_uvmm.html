<div class="textblock"><h2>Command Line Options </h2>
<p>uvmm provides the following command line options:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-c, --cmdline=&lt;guest command line&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">Command line that is passed to the guest on boot.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-k, --kernel=&lt;kernel image name&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">The name of the guest-kernel image file present in the ROM namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-d, --dtb=&lt;DTB overlay&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">The name of the device tree file present in the ROM namespace.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-r, --ramdisk=&lt;RAM disk name&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">The name of the RAM disk file present in the ROM namespace</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-b, --rambase=&lt;Base address of the guest RAM&gt;</code></p>
<p class="startli">Physical start address for the guest RAM. This value is platform specific.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-D, --debug=[&lt;component&gt;=][level]</code></p>
<p class="startli">Control the verbosity level of the uvmm. Possible <code>level</code> values are: quiet, warn, info, trace</p>
<p class="startli">Using the <code>component</code> prefix, the verbosity level of each uvmm component is configurable. The component names are: core, cpu, mmio, irq, dev, pm, vbus_event</p>
<p class="startli">For example, the following command line sets the verbosity of all uvmm components to <code>info</code> except for IRQ handling, which is set to <code>trace</code>. </p><pre class="fragment">uvmm -D info -D irq=trace
</pre></li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-q, --quiet</code></p>
<p class="startli">Silence all uvmm output.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-v, --verbose</code></p>
<p class="startli">Increase the verbosity of the uvmm. Repeating the option increases the verbosity by another level.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="startli"><code>-W, --wakeup-on-system-resume</code></p>
<p class="startli">When set, the uvmm resumes when the host system resumes after a suspend call.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2>Setting up guest memory </h2>
<p>In the most simple setup, memory for the guest can be provided via a simple dataspace. In your ned script, create a new dataspace of the required size and hand it into uvmm as the <code>ram</code> capability: </p><pre class="fragment">local ramds = L4.Env.user_factory:create(L4.Proto.Dataspace, 60 * 1024 * 1024)

L4.default_loader::startv({caps = {ram = ramds:m("rw")}}, "rom/uvmm")
</pre><p> The memory will be mapped to the most appropriate place and a memory node added to the device tree, so that the guest can find the memory.</p>
<p>For a more complex setup, the memory can be configured via the device tree. uvmm scans for memory nodes and tries to set up the memory from them. A memory device node should look like this: </p><pre class="fragment">memory@0 {
  device_type = "memory";
  reg = &lt;0x00000000 0x00100000
         0x00200000 0xffffffff&gt;;
  l4vmm,dscap = "memcap";
  l4vmm,physmap;
  dma-ranges = &lt;&gt;;
};
</pre><p> The <code>device_type</code> property is mandatory and needs to be set to <code>memory</code>.</p>
<p><code>l4vmm,dscap</code> contains the name of the capability containing the dataspace to be used for the RAM. <code>reg</code> describe the memory regions to use for the memory. The regions will be filled up to the size of the supplied dataspace. If they are larger, then the remaining area will be cut.</p>
<p><code>l4vmm,physmap</code> indicates that uvmm should try to map the dataspace to its actual physical address when no IOMMU is available. If the physical address cannot be determined or an IOMMU is available, then the memory will be mapped to the addresses supplied in <code>regs</code>. It is possible to omit the <code>regs</code> property when <code>l4vmm,physmap</code> is set. In this case, uvmm will fail to start if the physical address cannot be determined.</p>
<p>If a <code>dma-ranges</code> property is given, the host-physical address ranges for the memory regions will be added here. Note that the property is not cleared first, so it should be left empty.</p>
<h3>Memory layout</h3>
<p>uvmm populates the RAM with the following data:</p>
<ul>
<li>kernel binary</li>
<li>(optional) ramdisk</li>
<li>(optional) device tree</li>
</ul>
<p>The kernel binary is put at the predefined address. For ELF binaries, this is an absolute physical address. If the binary supports relative addressing, the binary is put to the requested offset relative to beginning of the first 'memory' region defined in the device tree.</p>
<p>The ramdisk and device tree are placed as far as possible to the end of the regions defined in the first 'memory' node.</p>
<p>If there is a part of RAM that must remain empty, then define an extra memory node for it in the device tree. uvmm only writes to memory in the first memory node it finds.</p>
<p>Warning: uvmm does not touch any unpopulated memory. In particular, it does not ensure that the memory is cleared. It is the responsibility of the provider of the RAM dataspace to make sure that no data leakage can happen. Normally this is not an issue because dataspaces are guaranteed to be cleaned when they are newly created but users should be careful when reusing memory or dataspaces, for example, when restarting the uvmm.</p>
<h2>Forwarding hardware resources to the guest </h2>
<p>Hardware resources must be specified in two places: the device tree contains the description of all hardware devices the guest could see and the Vbus describes which resources are actually available to the uvmm.</p>
<p>The vbus allows the uvmm access to hardware resources in the same way as any other <a class="el" href="namespaceL4.html" title="L4 low-level kernel interface.">L4</a> application. uvmm expects a capability named 'vbus' where it can access its hardware resources. It is possible to leave out the capability for purely virtual guests (Note that this is not actually practical on some architectures. On ARM, for example, the guest needs hardware access to the interrupt controller. Without a 'vbus' capability, interrupts will not work.) For information on how to configure a vbus, see the <a class="el" href="io.html">IO documentation</a>.</p>
<p>The device tree needs to contain the hardware description the guest should see. For hardware devices this usually means to use a device tree that would also be used when running the guest directly on hardware.</p>
<p>On startup, uvmm scans the device tree for any devices that require memory or interrupt resources and compares the required resources with the ones available from its vbus. When all resources are available, it sets up the appropriate forwarding, so that the guest now has direct access to the hardware. If the resources are not available, the device will be marked as 'disabled'. This mechanism allows to work with a standard device tree for all guests in the system while handling the actual resource allocation in a flexible manner via the vbus configuration.</p>
<p>The default mechanism assigns all resources 1:1, i.e. with the same memory address and interrupt number as on hardware. It is also possible to map a hardware device to a different location. In this case, the assignment between vbus device and device tree device must be known in advance and marked in the device tree using the <code>l4vmm,vbus-dev</code> property.</p>
<p>The following device will for example be bound with the vbus device with the HID 'l4-test,dev': </p><pre class="fragment">test@e0000000 {
    compatible = "memdev,bar";
    reg = &lt;0 0xe0000000 0 0x50000&gt;,
          &lt;0 0xe1000000 0 0x50000&gt;;
    l4vmm,vbus-dev = "l4-test,dev";
    interrupts-extended = &lt;&amp;gic 0 139 4&gt;;
};
</pre><p> Resources are then matched by name. Memory resources in the vbus must be named <code>reg0</code> to <code>reg9</code> to match against the address ranges in the device tree <code>reg</code> property. Interrupts must be called <code>irq0</code> to <code>irq9</code> and will be matched against <code>interrupts</code> or <code>interrupts-extended</code> entries in the device tree. The vbus must expose resources for all resources defined in the device tree entry or the initialisation will fail.</p>
<p>An appropriate IO entry for the above device would thus be: </p><pre class="fragment">MEM = Io.Hw.Device(function()
    Property.hid = "l4-test,dev"
    Resource.reg0 = Io.Res.mmio(0x41000000, 0x4104ffff)
    Resource.reg1 = Io.Res.mmio(0x42000000, 0x4204ffff)
    Resource.irq0 = Io.Res.irq(134);
end)
</pre><p> Please note that HIDs on the vbus are not necessarily unique. If multiple devices with the HID given in <code>l4vmm,vbus-dev</code> are available on the vbus, then one device is chosen at random.</p>
<p>If no vbus device with the given HID is available, the device is disabled.</p>
<h2>How to enable guest suspend/resume </h2>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Currently only supported on ARM. It should work fine with Linux version 4.4 or newer.</dd></dl>
<p>Uvmm (partially) implements the power state coordination interface (PSCI), which is the standard ARM power management interface. To make use of this interface, you have to announce its availability to the guest operating system via the device tree like so: </p><pre class="fragment">psci {
      compatible = "arm,psci-0.2";
      method = "hvc";
};
</pre><p> The Linux guest must be configured with at least these options: </p><pre class="fragment">CONFIG_SUSPEND=y
CONFIG_ARM_PSCI=y
</pre> <h2>How to communicate power management (PM) events </h2>
<p>Uvmm can be instructed to inform a PM manager of PM events through the <a class="el" href="classL4_1_1Platform__control.html" title="L4 C++ interface for controlling platform-wide properties.">L4::Platform_control</a> interface. To that end, uvmm may be equipped with a <code>pfc</code> cap. On suspend, uvmm will call <a class="el" href="group__l4__platform__control__api.html#ga56b855fa63a3d94b275bdd17bb0bc21e" title="Enter suspend to RAM.">l4_platform_ctl_system_suspend()</a>.</p>
<p>The <code>pfc</code> cap can also be implemented by IO. In that case the guest can start a machine suspend/shutdown/reboot.</p>
<h2>Ram block device support </h2>
<p>The example ramdisk works by loading a file system into RAM, which needs RAM block device support to work. In the Linux kernel configuration add: CONFIG_BLK_DEV_RAM=y</p>
<h2>Recommended Linux configuration options for uvmm/amd64 guests </h2>
<p>The following options are recommended in additon to the amd64 defaults provided by a <code>make defconfig</code>:</p>
<p>Virtio support is required to access virtual devices provided by uvmm: </p><pre class="fragment"> CONFIG_VIRTIO=y
 CONFIG_VIRTIO_PCI=y
 CONFIG_VIRTIO_BLK=y
 CONFIG_BLK_MQ_VIRTIO=y
 CONFIG_VIRTIO_CONSOLE=y
 CONFIG_VIRTIO_INPUT=y
 CONFIG_VIRTIO_NET=y
</pre><p> It is highly recommended to use the X2APIC, which needs virtualization awareness to work under uvmm: </p><pre class="fragment"> CONFIG_X86_X2APIC=y
 CONFIG_PARAVIRT=y
 CONFIG_PARAVIRT_SPINLOCKS=y
</pre> <h2>KVM clock for uvmm/amd64 guests </h2>
<p>When executing <a class="el" href="namespaceL4Re.html" title="L4Re C++ Interfaces.">L4Re</a> + uvmm on QEMU, the PIT as clock source is not reliable. The paravirtualized KVM clock provides the guest with a stable clock source.</p>
<p>A KVM clock device is available to the guest, if the device tree contains the corresponding entry: </p><pre class="fragment">kvm_clock {
    compatible = "kvm-clock";
    reg = &lt;0x0 0x0 0x0 0x0&gt;;
};
</pre><p> To make use of this clock, the Linux guest must be built with the following configuration options: </p><pre class="fragment">CONFIG_HYPERVISOR_GUEST=y
CONFIG_KVM_GUEST=y
CONFIG_PTP_1588_CLOCK_KVM is not set
</pre><p> Note: KVM calls besides the KVM clock are unhandled and lead to failure in the uvmm, e.g. vmcall 0x9 for the PTP_1588_CLOCK_KVM.</p>
<p>This is considered a development feature. The KVM clock is not required when running on physical hardware as TSC calibration via the PIT works as expected.</p>
<h2>Development notes for amd64 </h2>
<p>When you are developing on Linux using QEMU please note that nested virtualization support is necessary on your host system to run uvmm guests. Your host Linux version should be 4.12 or greater, <b>excluding 4.20</b>.</p>
<p>To have KVM support nested virtualization you need to enable it via: </p><pre class="fragment">modprobe kvm_intel nested=1
</pre><p> uvmm does currently not support AMD-V.</p>
<h2>Using the uvmm monitor interface </h2>
<p>Uvmm implements an interface with which parts of the guest's state can be queried and manipulated at runtime. This monitor interface needs to be enabled during compilation as well as during startup of uvmm. This is described in detail below.</p>
<h3>Compiling uvmm with monitor interface support</h3>
<p>To compile uvmm with monitor interface support pass the <code>CONFIG_MONITOR=y</code>, option during the <code>make</code> step (or set in in the Makefile.config). This option is available on all architectures but note that the set of available monitor interface features may vary significantly between them. Also note that the monitor interface will always be disabled in release mode, i.e. if <code>CONFIG_RELEASE_MODE=y</code>.</p>
<h3>Enabling the monitor interface at runtime</h3>
<p>When starting a uvmm instance from inside a <code>ned</code> script using the <code>vmm.start_vm</code> function, the <code>mon</code> argument controls whether the monitor interface is enabled at runtime. There are three cases to distinguish:</p>
<ul>
<li><code>mon=true</code> (default): The monitor interface is enabled but no server implementing the client side of the monitor interface is started. The monitor interface can still be utilized via <code>cons</code> but no readline functionality will be available.</li>
<li>&lsquo;mon='some_binary&rsquo;<code>: If a string is passed as the value of</code>mon`, the monitor interface is enabled and the string is interpreted as the name of a server binary which implements the client side of the monitor interface. This server is automatically started and has access to a vcon capability named <code>mon</code> at startup through which it can make use of the monitor interface. Unless you have written your own server you should specify &lsquo;'uvmm_cli&rsquo;` which is a server implementing a simple readline interface.</li>
<li><code>mon=false</code>: The monitor interface is disabled at runtime.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Using the monitor interface</h3>
<p>If the monitor interface was enabled you can connect to it via <code>cons</code> under the name <code>mon&lt;n&gt;</code> where <code>&lt;n&gt;</code> is a unique integer for every uvmm instance that is started with the monitor interface enabled (numbered starting from one in order of corresponding <code>vmm.start_vm</code> calls). If &lsquo;mon='uvmm_cli&rsquo;` was specified, readline functionality such as command completion and history will be available. Enter a command followed by enter to run that command. To obtain a list of all available commands issue the <code>help</code> command, to obtain usage information for a specific command <code>foo</code> issue <code>help foo</code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>Some commands will modify the guests state. Since it should be obvious to which ones this applies this is usually not specifically highlighted. Exercise reasonable caution.</dd></dl>
<h3>Using the guest debugger</h3>
<p>The guest debugger provides monitoring functionality akin to a very bare-bone GDB interface, e.g. guest RAM and page table dumping, breakpointing and single stepping. Additional functionality might be added in the future.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>The guest debugger is currently still under development. The guest debugger may also not be available on all architectures. To check whether the guest debugger is available check if <code>help dbg</code> returns usage information.</dd></dl>
<p>If the guest debugger is available, you have to manually load it at runtime using the monitor interface. This saves resources if the guest debugger is not used. To enable the guest debugger, issue the <code>dbg on</code> monitor command. Once enabled, the guest debugger can not be disabled again.</p>
<p>To list available guest debugger subcommands, issue <code>dbg help</code> after <code>dbg on</code>.</p>
<dl class="section note"><dt>Note</dt><dd>When using SMP, most guest debugger subcommands require you to explicitly specify a guest vcpu using an index starting from zero. </dd></dl>

This is an emulator for 16-bit x86 code. The project x86emu was written by
SciTech (the business was shutdown sometime around 2006/2007) and is under
a BSD style license, compatible with the XFree86 and X licenses used by
XFree86 (see license at lib/src/LICENSE). This library is used by XFree86 4.xx
to emulate x86 BIOS calls on operating systems which do not support the vm86
mode.

There is an L4Linux kernel module (examples/linux_stub) which offers
functionality to emulate the sys_vm86old() system call. sys_vm86old()
is used by XFree86. In L4Linux, we have to ensure that we have access to
the whole 1MB address space which was set up by the Linux program which
want to execute some code using the vm86 mode.

The library lib/int10 provides support for executing BIOS calls, e.g. for
mode switching via the VESA bios.
